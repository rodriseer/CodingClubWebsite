                                <strong>What is Object-Oriented Programming?</strong><br>
                                Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which represent real-world entities. 
                                Each object can contain data (attributes) and methods (functions) that define its behavior. This approach makes it easier to model complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components.
